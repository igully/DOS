File Descriptions:
-----------------

COLOUR - In EDR-DOS, COLOUR is present as a statement in its CONFIG.SYS 
         counterpart. Its syntax is quite cumbersome for average users to 
         comprehend. So, much like the FASTOPEN external command in DR-DOS, 
         this particular implementation of COLOUR helps to clarify its 
         functionality and proper usage (For Enhanced DR-DOS only).
         
FASTOPEN - This particular implementation of FASTOPEN helps to clarify its 
           functionality and proper usage. It is even smaller in size than its 
           original version (For DR-DOS, Enhanced DR-DOS, OpenDOS, Novell DOS, 
           and its siblings. Not for MS-DOS, PC-DOS, etc.).
           
HISTORY - In the DR-DOS family of products, HISTORY is present as a statement 
          in its CONFIG.SYS counterpart. Its syntax is quite cumbersome for 
          average users to comprehend. So, much like the FASTOPEN external 
          command in DR-DOS, this particular implementation of HISTORY helps 
          to clarify its functionality and proper usage (For DR-DOS, Enhanced 
          DR-DOS, OpenDOS, Novell DOS, and its siblings. Not for MS-DOS, 
          PC-DOS, etc.).

SANE - An all-in-one reboot and shutdown program for DOS that works on any PC, 
       even on ancient 8088 XT and, of course, on a modern ATX one, where it 
       actually powers down the system. It also has a few extras like BIOS 
       password resetting and attempts to stabilize DOS when chaos ensues.
